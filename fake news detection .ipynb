       "'A debate for Denver’s District 10 City Council seat was scheduled to soon begin, but as the incumbent, Chris Hinds, arrived, organizers appeared puzzled when they saw him in a wheelchair, which he has used since 2008.\\n\\nThe debate stage at Cleo Parker Robinson Dance, which was sponsoring the event, did not have an accessible option for wheelchairs. Realizing it would be difficult to lift the 400-pound wheelchair and the 200-pound councilman onto the stage, organizers offered a suggestion, Mr. Hinds said: Could he get himself onto the stage and then they could lift the wheelchair?\\n\\nWith his three opponents already there, and roughly 100 attendees in their seats, Mr. Hinds — who is paralyzed from the chest down from an accident while cycling — began to lift himself with his hands onto the stage.\\n\\n“I’m thinking, ‘I look like a circus monkey. I am a circus monkey,’” Mr. Hinds said on Saturday. “And all these folks who are here to determine who their next City Council member is — they see me just floundering.”'"
